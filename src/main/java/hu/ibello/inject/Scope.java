/**
 * <p>
 * This enum specifies the <em>scope</em> of a dependency injection. During the injection, the injector
 * should decide that it will use a previously created value, of will create a whole new instance.
 * It is allowed to use existing values only from the injection's current scope. If there is no valid value for the
 * injection, a new instance will be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These are the scopes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>PROTOTYPE: if the injected class is in this scope, then every new request will result a new instance.</li>
 * <li>TEST: this scope is valid while the current test method runs.</li>
 * <li>SPECIFICATION: this scope is valid while the test class (<em>specification</em>) is unchanged. </li>
 * <li>SESSION: this scope means a java thread.</li>
 * <li>SINGLETON: this scopes will be not invalidated, all instances created in it will be persisted for
 * the whole test execution.</li>
 * <li>PAGE: classes marked with this scope should be handled as session-scoped, but after the "normal"
 * injection some other special (page object-related) injections should be performed on them.</li>
 * <li>STEPS: classes marked with this scope should be handled as session-scoped, but after the "normal"
 * injection some other special (step library-related) injections should be performed on them.</li>
