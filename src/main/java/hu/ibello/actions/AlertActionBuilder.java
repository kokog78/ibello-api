/**
 * Interface for building an <em>action</em> with an alert window.
 * It contains fluent methods to build and execute interactive operations on the alert window.
 * <p>
 * During an action, the <em>ibello</em> tries to interact with the alert window.
 * If the interaction fails, it will try it again and again, until it successes or the time
 * runs out. By default, an action uses the <em>ibello</em>
 * default timeout, but it can be changed with the {@link #withTimeout(Enum)} or
 * {@link #withTimeout(String)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In some cases it is useful to wait a few seconds after an interaction occurred on the page.
 * The action may change the page structure dynamically, or can navigate to another page.
 * With the {@link #withPageRefreshWait()} method, this wait can be performed right after
 * the action finishes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During test execution, every action is logged with it's additional information. If an action
 * fails, then the test will be marked with "error" flag, and not with "failed". This is a
 * difference between actions and expectations - see {@link hu.ibello.expect}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link AlertActionBuilder} instance can be obtained on page objects, with {@link PageObject#doWith(Alert)}
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * doWith(browser().alert()).accept();
 * </pre>
