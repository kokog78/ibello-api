/**
 * <p>
 * An instance of this interface represents an element on a web-page.
 * The existence of a WebElement instance does not state that the underlying element exists on the page.
 * It just stores the search criteria and another information about the element. Later, when the
 * WebElement instance is used, will be verified that the underlying element exists or not.
 * Therefore it is safe to store a WebElement instance and use it later.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A WebElement instance does not have direct methods to manipulate the element itself or
 * do some assertions with it - these are available from page objects. (See {@link PageObject}.)
 * During element manipulation and verification the <em>ibello</em> reruns the search again
 * if necessary. A typical example is when an element on a page is recreated by javascript code
 * after the search. In this case, the original element is not present anymore so it can't be clicked.
 * If someone tries to call a click action on it, then <em>ibello</em> recognizes the change and executes
 * the search again. Only if the second search does not finds anything will <em>ibello</em> throw an
 * exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The WebElement supports element search between it's descendants. For more information, see
 * {@link WebElement#find()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a WebElement instance was obtained by a search which received parameters, then there is an option to
 * change these parameters later, and rerun the search - see {@link WebElement#applyParameters(Object...)}.
 * </p>

	 * <p>
	 * A WebElement instance can be created with an <em>element search</em> - see {@link SearchTool} and
	 * {@link PageObject}. During the
	 * search some parameters can be specified, which are substituted into the search pattern. The WebElement
	 * instance stores these parameters, and we can change them to indicate a new search later, when the instance
	 * is going to be used.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * It is possible to <em>not</em> define the parameters at the time of the creation of a WebElement instance,
	 * and set them later, before the instance is used. Example (from a page object):
	 * </p>
	 * <pre>
	 * {@literal //} search an element without specifying the parameter
	 * {@literal @}Find("#button-${0}")
	 * WebElement button;
	 * 
	 * public clickButton(int index) {
	 *     {@literal //} set the parameter and therefore rerun the search then click the element
	 *     doWith(button.applyParameters(index)).click();
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * @param parameters the new search parameters
	 * @return the current WebElement instance
