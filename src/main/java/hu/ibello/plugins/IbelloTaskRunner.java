 * Task runner is something which runs named tasks. It is possible to run a task by it's name from command line.
 * The task runner receives the name in the {@link #runTask(String)} method and tries to perform the task.
 * If it is possible - because the runner recognizes the name - then the method returns <code>true</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A task runner may have a readable name. For that, multiple options are available.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>The task runner can have a descriptor in JSON format. The file should be available on the classpath,
 * in the same package where the class is. The descriptor can have a "title" property which contains the readable
 * name.</li>
 * <li>If there is no descriptor file or it does not contain a non-empty title then it is possible to set
 * the readable name with the {@link Name} annotation which should be placed on the class.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to interact with the ibello infrastructure in the executed task. For this, the parameter of the
 * {@link #initialize(PluginInitializer)} method should be used. The {@link PluginInitializer#getConfigurationValue(String)}
 * is useful to access configuration parameters and command line options. With {@link PluginInitializer#testData()} method
 * an ibello test data can be loaded.
