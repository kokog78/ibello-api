 * Fake email server API (as a part of the <em>ibello</em> toolbox).
 * <p>
 * Some programs are sending emails to recipients, and in some cases we want to verify that an email with some attributes was sent.
 * For this, we need to inject {@link hu.ibello.toolbox.email.FakeEmailServer} into a step library and use it to check the emails.
