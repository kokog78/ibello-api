/**
 * This interface is designed for checking email communication during "ibello" tests.
 * Some programs are sending emails to recipients, and in some cases we want to verify that an email with some attributes was sent.
 * To use this tool you need to prepare your tests a little bit.
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>Firstly, you need to change you system under test and set the SMTP host and port for it. With this setting, all email communications
 * originated by the system will go to the "fake" email server. (So the system will not send those emails to the real recipients, but you will be able to
 * check them.)</p>
 * <p>In many cases it is enough to set the <code>mail.smtp.host</code> system property to <code>"localhost"</code>, and set
 * the <code>mail.smtp.port</code> property to the port where we want to run our fake server. But the correct setup depends on
 * the tested system - contact your developers if you are unsure about it.</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Secondly, you need to add a {@link FakeEmailServer} instance to your step libraries, with the {@link Inject} annotation:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * private FakeEmailServer emailServer;
 * </pre>
 * <p>The server is in session scope, but it controls a singleton SMTP server.</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>Before you want to use the email server, you need to start it. Call the {@link #start(int)} method with your selected port number.
 * Typically you can do this in a {@link Before} block. It is not possible to start two servers on different ports in the same time.</p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>At the end, you can stop the server with the {@link #stop()} method. A good place for that is an {@link After} block.
 * If you do not stop it, it will be automatically stopped after the test execution.</p>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>The expectations in this class are working similarly to other "ibello" expectations. They are also logged out and inserted into the result report.
 * You can put them into complex expectations as well.</p>
