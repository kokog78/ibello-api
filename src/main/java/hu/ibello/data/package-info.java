/**
 * This package contains interfaces for test data handling.
 * <p>
 * Test data is something which is used in tests as an input or assertion value.
 * For example, if the test enters some text into a text field, then the text can be stored
 * as test data. On the other side, if a test expects that a field on the page contains a
 * specific text, then that text also can be stored as test data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Test data can be stored in different formats, in files. The ibello is able to load the test
 * data into complex objects. Test data classes are simple POJOs and can be marked with the {@link hu.ibello.data.Model}
 * annotation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The test data objects can be loaded with the {@link hu.ibello.data.TestDataBuilder} interface.
