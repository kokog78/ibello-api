 * This interface specifies a test data loader which loads data from a java property file.
 * Because java property files are simple name-value maps, therefore the loaded result is
 * also a plain {@link Values} instance which stores key-value pairs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main method of this interface is the {@link #load()}. It returns the loaded {@link Values} instance.
 * The {@link #loadString()} method returns the property file content of the test data.
 * The {@link #openStream()} method opens a stream which contains this content.
