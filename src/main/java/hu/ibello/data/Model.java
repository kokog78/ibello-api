/**
 * <p>
 * With this annotation we can mark if a class is used to hold test data.
 * For example, we can create the User class:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Model
 * public class User {
 * 
 *     public String id;
 *     public String username;
 *     public boolean male;
 * 
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If we use the annotation, then in some circumstances, the ibello will be able to notice
 * that the class can be used to load test data into it.
