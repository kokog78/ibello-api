 * This class is designed for load test data from the filesystem.

 * According to the file format, we can start a loader operation with one of these methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #fromProperties(String)}: data loading from java property file(s)</li>
 * <li>{@link #fromJson(Class)}: data loading from JSON file(s)</li>
 * <li>{@link #fromBinary(String)}: data loading from any kind of file(s)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Data files are stored in the data directory. By default this is the <code>ibello/data</code>
 * folder, but we can change this with the <code>ibello.dir.data</code> configuration parameter.

	/**
	 * <p>
	 * Returns an object which can be used to load test data from a java property file.
	 * For that, we need to specify a file name prefix. The name of the loaded file
	 * will start with that prefix, followed by a dot. The final extension of the file will
	 * be <code>.properties</code>. Between the prefix and the extension the file name may contain
	 * tags, separated by dashes. Examples:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>prefix.properties</code></li>
	 * <li><code>prefix.tag1.properties</code></li>
	 * <li><code>prefix.tag1-tag2.properties</code></li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * During the loading process, the loader creates a list of available and matching files,
	 * then it sorts them by precedence. At first, the first file will be loaded. If they are other matching files,
	 * then the second one will be loaded, and it's properties will override the properties of the first file.
	 * Other matching files are loaded in that order, and also update the previously loaded properties.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Each loaded files should have the specified prefix. If a file name also have tags, then they will be validated
	 * against the current ibello tags. If a file has a tag which was <b>not</b> specified as an ibello tag, then
	 * that file will be <b>not</b> loaded. In other words, loaded files should not have unspecified tags.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The first loaded file will be the one without tags (if any). The remaining files will be sorted by the number of tags
	 * and the tags itself (in alphabetical order). Examples:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>prefix.a.properties</code> will be loaded before <code>prefix.b.properties</code></li>
	 * <li><code>prefix.c.properties</code> will be loaded before <code>prefix.a-b.properties</code></li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * If two loaded files have the same property, then the latest file's property will be in the final result.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The files can be placed into sub-directories, the loader will find them automatically.

	 * Returns an object which can be used to load test data from a JSON file.
	 * For that we must specify a java class which will receive all data from the JSON file.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The name of the file starts with the lower-case name of the java class (without package name).
	 * It may be followed by a dash sign and an identifier. Then comes a dot. At this position the file name may
	 * contain tags, separated by dash signs. The extension of the file is always <code>json</code>. Examples:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>myclass.json</code></li>
	 * <li><code>myclass.tag1.json</code></li>

	 * followed by a dash sign and the identifier. If a file name also have tags, then it will be validated
	 * against the current ibello tags. If a file has a tag which was <b>not</b> specified as an ibello tag, then
	 * that file will be <b>not</b> loaded. In other words, loaded files should not have unspecified tags.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The first loaded file will be the one without identifier and tags (if any). Then comes the files without identifier but
	 * with one or more tags. The remaining files (with identifier) will be sorted by the number of tags and

	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>myclass.json</code> will be loaded before <code>myclass.a.json</code></li>
	 * <li><code>myclass.a.json</code> will be loaded before <code>myclass-id.json</code></li>
	 * <li><code>myclass.a.json</code> will be loaded before <code>myclass.b.json</code></li>
	 * <li><code>myclass.c.json</code> will be loaded before <code>myclass.a-b.json</code></li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * The files can be placed into sub-directories, the loader will find them automatically.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * By default, the objects loaded from the JSON files will be fully merged in the result. Element of arrays will be joined together.
	 * For example, the first two JSON object will result the third one:
	 * </p>
	 * <pre>
	 * {
	 *     "a": 1,
	 *     "b": {
	 *         "b1": 1, "b2": 1, "b3": {"b3_1": 1}

	 *     "c": [1]
	 * }
	 * 
	 * {
	 *     "a": 2,
	 *     "b": {
	 *         "b1": 2, "b3": {"b3_2": 2}
